Our approach considers two key aspects: learning outcomes (Los) and learning materials (LMs). The system includes data acquisition and preprocessing, ranking mechanisms, prompt engineering, and evaluation methods. It allows querying to find similar questions based on similarity ranking. Our approach demonstrates promising results compared to traditional methods, deep learning techniques, and other LLM-based approaches.
